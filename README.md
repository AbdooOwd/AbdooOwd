# Introducing: Introduction - The First
'Sup Github. I'm @AbdooOwd. I'm a *<insert age>* years old Algerian guy who loves
Computer Science and Science in general. I'm smart and curious, and I always ~~break~~ try
new things, sometimes, when I feel like doing it.

# Knowledge
I'm familiar with numerous concepts, like:
* Computer Architecture
* Memory Management
* How an OS works
* Programming Languages (in general)
* Web Development (partially)
* Low-Level Programming (I contributed to [ZeldaRET's Majora's Mask Decompilation](https://github.com/ZeldaRET/mm/) and made a 32bit then 64bit OS)

## Programming Language
I'm allso pretty familiar with many programming languages like:
* Python
* C/C++ (I have less experience with C++)
* Haxe (I worked on some Friday Night Funkin Mods, a game that uses Haxe)
* GDScript (Programming Language similar to Python for the Godot Game Engine)
* JavaScript/TypeScript
* Rust (REALLY Partially)

# Likes
I like Gaming, Art, and Knowledge. To be specific, I like gaming in general (when I appreciate certain games).
I like arts, I sometimes draw and animate, and I like taking a look at pinterest.
I like learning. Either by adding knowledge to my "Mental Library" or trying to improve myself.
